# Python Automation

## Overview

This project is designed to automate repetitive tasks using Python scripts, reducing manual effort and improving efficiency. Whether itâ€™s automating file management, web scraping, data processing, or task scheduling, this project serves as a foundation for building versatile automation solutions.

## Features

- **Task Scheduling**: Automate tasks based on time intervals or specific triggers.
- **Web Scraping**: Extract information from websites and automate data collection processes.
- **File Management**: Automatically organize, move, rename, or delete files in a directory based on specific criteria.
- **Data Processing**: Automate the extraction, transformation, and loading (ETL) of data.
- **API Integration**: Interact with external APIs to automate data retrieval or posting.
- **Error Handling**: Built-in error handling mechanisms for seamless and robust automation.

## Prerequisites

To use or contribute to this project, ensure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.x
- Required Python libraries (listed in `requirements.txt`):
  - `requests`
  - `beautifulsoup4`
  - `pandas`
  - `schedule`
  - `selenium` (if applicable)

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
